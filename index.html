                    <i>What is there to be known : </i> On Sunday 24 November 2019, at exactly 9.03am, the Bank of Lisbon in the historic city centre of Johannesburg is imploded in 8 seconds. A carefully orchestrated operation which takes a year to prepare. Surrounding buildings are evacuated. The base of the building has been lined with large tyres. That morning, the site resembles a stage set with monumental sails 25 meters high, strung across the entire city block to prevent damage to neighbouring buildings from any air blasts or ‘escaping’ debris. Fences block streets. Fire trucks and emergency vans are on standby.  Police cordon off the area and smalls crowds gather at a pre-scribed safe distance, in the ‘green zone’.  The building is charged with 2363 conventional mining explosives, nearly a ton. These are embedded into the building’s columns in exactly marked, predrilled holes - a structural, surgical procedure. Each column is wrapped several times with diamond-mesh fencing and layers of geotextile material which must absorb the shock and blast from detonation.  Design and sequence of the implosion follow the  strategic logic of demolition engineering: explosive-induced collapse. It calculates what forces need to be released at precisely what points for 31 storeys to fold progressively, to break up under gravity and deposit into the foundation ‘in the most compact form’. Impact cushions have been installed in the basement to minimise ground vibration.

                    Elated anticipation is palpable that morning. The sirens start and the crowd grows very quiet. I first hear the building ignite, then see it drop. And yet do not know what I really saw. Dust clouds rise and expand with surprising velocity. Fine residue of built material quickly coats the streets, settles on cars and clothes, and enters lungs. In witnessing the implosion, a strangely symbolic, tense and spectacular event, what is undone?

                <p>
                    6 months later I search for the site on google maps to verify street names (I always forget): corner Albertina Sisulu and Pixley Ka Isaka Seme St. On the map, the building is still ‘live’ and marked as ‘department of local government and housing’. In this way, satellite signals extend the lifetime of the structure in a kind of seamless, automated present. The google location simultaneous shows a sideview of the building’s facade as it begins to collapse. It is this image arrested in midair that summons what has not been resolved: The cause of the fire which lasted over 3 days and the death of three firefighters on the first day of the fire.   Investigations into building compliance levels and due processes were carried out by the City’s Occupational Health and Safety Unit and Johannesburg’s Quality Assurance, and an independent expert hired by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to determine what led to the death of the firefighters and whether all procedures were followed by their teams on the day.  A criminal inquest was conducted by the South African Police Service.  Herein lies the offense: To this day, no reports have been released publicly and no crime or human error accounted for by those ‘in charge’. Affected families, firefighters and employees have no closure. For now, this vacuum is subsumed by COVID 19 emergencies, an unimagined recalibration of ‘maintenance’, crisis and systemic dysfunction. In the process, the city’s psychosocial fabric is reconditioned, effecting every resident, workplace, city official and medical personnel.

                    <i>31 storeys amount to 108 meters. </i>I read that the Bank of Lisbon was built in 1967 and completed in 3 years, the year of my birth.  It is classified as a late 1960s ‘brutalist skyscraper’ –a weighty architectural style associated with post war Europe, and implanted as such in this place. It is defined by a conviction for minimalist, geometric design, clean lines and a preference for concrete, steel and glass, material associated with the aesthetics of the modernist 20th century city. Typically, the building featured a curtain wall, a non-loadbearing ‘skin’ made of prefabricated glass and aluminium panels, designed to  regulate and shield the interior climate from wind loads, rain and the evolving heat of the sun.  At the time of the Apartheid building boom, the building’s plan and technology would have been considered contemporary, befitting the image of a new bank.  It towered over the much smaller, ‘Italianite’ Public Library across the road, which was built with stone in the 1930s. The immediate neighbour to the north is home to one of the city’s oldest daily newspaper and archive, The Star. Opposite from The Star and at an angle to the Bank of Lisbon, lies Luthuli House, headquarters of the African National Congress since 1997. Significant neighbors in the city’s organism.

                    <i>I ask my friend about the Bank of Lisbon. </i>He worked here in the health department on AIDS awareness campaigns in the late 90s, early 2000s. He says, ‘the building didn't figure much compared to the media work we were doing’, effectively against AIDS denialism of the government at the time’.  Windows did not open, the lifts often did not work. The basement parking was ‘useful’ but ‘reeked of sewage’. After a pause he adds,<span>‘The MECs  occupied the 23rd floor, one of them marbled the entire floor. Maybe they liked skidding and sliding. The machinery of the air conditioning was on the 13th floor. A dusty and dirty floor, like being in the bag of a giant vacuum cleaner. It did pump warm and bad air throughout the building.’</span> He recalls scandals of misspent money in the health department. My question puts him into a bad mood, even though he remembers ‘good views to the west of the city, a purple haze hanging over Fordsburg and beyond’. And watching a solar eclipse in 2001, when it was one of the few tall buildings in the area that was not bricked up (including Luthuli House).

                <p>
                    Later that day, he emails me about a painting he did at the time: <span>‘The shape, lower right, is one of the health directors screaming while wearing a neck brace; then there's the lift, a confinement in which one could sample the foetid breath of fellow workers; the somewhat crushed cars represent the aforementioned basement parking. The tall grey figure represents a man I worked with who had been tortured by the police, made to stand on a brick till inevitably he fell off, for which he was beaten. He felt compelled to share this with me. The rest is too obscure to go into. Fire and implosion was too good for that building.’</span>
